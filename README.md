# FeSafe

FeSafe
FeSafe (female safety) is an application which can help women in case of distress and empower them.

This application will be relevant in different situations depending on the type of emergency.

Features
Ride hailing applications : The location will be shared with selected contacts while using Uber, Ola, RedBus etc.

Safe spot location : This will immediately point out all the safe locations nearby, for example police stations.

SOS alarm : This will trigger a siren and send distress calls to specific contacts and NCW (National Commission for Women).

Cyber bullying prevention : The application will scan for harmful content and point it out before the user posts it on social media.

Awareness updates : The application will be informing the user about policies and laws related to women safety and raise awareness, on daily basis.

Scope for improvement
There is scope for decreasing cyber bullying. For example sensitive and offensive data can be blocked.

The application can be evolved to form a platform for women alone.

A feature can be added which can connect to all the people around having the same application nearby and contact them as well in case of emergency.
